# Historical_Figures-Solution--Machine-Learning
My solution to the Kaggle competition historical figures take 2

"How do historical figures' notoriety change over time? Which continents and countries have the most well known history? How does new technology change how we view the past?
These are very high level questions that will likely not be answered in this competition--but we will work on predicting how well known figures are based on some biographical information and some information pulled from their Wikipedia pages.

Hopefully this will give you a chance to cut your teeth on:

Data cleaning/preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis
Trying different models for a problem
One hot encoding
Data visualization"
